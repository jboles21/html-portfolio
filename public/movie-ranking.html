<h1>The Best Movies According to Joshua</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>
  This is the best rendition of what physics is capable of being. From the
  depiction of what the mysteries of what a black hole can contain all the way
  to what the fabrics of time and space are capable of within our universe.
</p>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>
  If you can see the pattern of my top movie choices, my love of movies are in
  connection to my love for manipulating reality itself. And inception is a
  great example of the reality bending posibilities that are capable of occuring
  once you understand the power of your mind.
</p>
<h3>Memento</h3>
<p>
  Now, this movie does not typically fall into the same category of the others,
  but if you look at the movie from a directing POV then it still has that
  reality bending perspective. I wont ruin it for you just go watch all 3.
